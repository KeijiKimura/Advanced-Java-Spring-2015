							<p> Axolotl's are my favorite animal for a lot of reasons.  
								Maybe a big reason is its uncanny resemblance to a favorite childhood Pokemon, but I digress.

										Aside from looking really cool, the Axolotl is a rare animal in that it develops neotenously.  That is, it doesn't mature until specific external conditions are met.  In other words, it's an immortal man-child until it comes into contact with iodine.
