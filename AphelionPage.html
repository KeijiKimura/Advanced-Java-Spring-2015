			<p> Aphelion is a collaborative project by Keiji Kimura, Danny Dang and Jasmine Martinez.  Players take on the roles of father and daughter simultaneously through a unique split screen mechanic.  While exploring a lush, minimally designed world, players can reunite the two by concocting potions and transforming into animals.  Completed in December 2014.</p>
